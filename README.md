# BruteForceStringGenerator
Brute force string generation by checking each character against a target at random. 

Results in a visually appealing "decryption" animation.

Inspired by a post on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/8fdyf0/i_heard_were_brute_forcing_hello_world_now/).
